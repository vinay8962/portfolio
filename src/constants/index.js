Both users and doctors have separate dashboards to manage their interactions. The system uses secure authentication and maintains appointment statuses like pending, completed, and canceled. This system simplifies the scheduling process, ensures better communication between patients and doctors, and enhances the overall efficiency of managing medical consultations.",
